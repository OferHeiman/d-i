    <h1>The Avengers</h1>
    <p id="AvengersDescription">The Avengers were a team of extraordinary individuals,<br>
         with either superpowers or other special characteristics.<br>
         Its purpose was to protect global stability from inner or extraterrestrial threats. <br>
         Though primarily affiliated with the United States of America,<br>
          they worked with the peaceful interests of the whole world in mind<br>
           rather than a specific country or organization.<br>
          The Avengers were first assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D. when Loki<br>
           invaded Earth with his Chitauri army to conquer the planet.<br>
           The team, consisting of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America,<br>
            Black Widow, Hawkeye and Hulk, defeated Loki. </p>
