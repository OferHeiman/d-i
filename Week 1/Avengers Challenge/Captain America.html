        Captain Steven Grant "Steve" Rogers is a World War II veteran,<br>
         a founding member of the Avengers, and Earth's first known superhero.<br>
         Rogers grew up suffering from numerous health problems,<br>
         and upon America's entry into World War II, <br>
         he was rejected from serving in the United States<br>
          Army despite several attempts to enlist.<br>
         Rogers ultimately volunteered for Project Rebirth,<br>
         where he was the only recipient of the Super Soldier Serum <br>
         developed by Abraham Erskine under the Strategic Scientific Reserve. <br>
         The serum greatly enhanced Rogers' physical abilities to superhuman levels.</p>
